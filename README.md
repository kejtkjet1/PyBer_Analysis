## Overview of Project

### Purpose

A deep dive into ride-sharing data to evaluate differences in fares by city type as well as weekly fare breakout by city type. The analysis to be provided to the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Analysis

Effect on school district metrict after the data was removed for the affected scores
- Total budgets remained unchanged
- Average math scores declined from  79% to 78.9%
- Average reading scores remained at 81.9%
- % Passing math declined from to 75% to 74.8%
- % Passing reading declined from to 85.8% 85.7%
- % Overall reading declined from to 65.2 to 64.9%

## Summary

- The clearing of the suspected altered scores had a marginal difference on the overall results. Most of the scores declined marginally. Scores affected were: average math score, % passing math, % passing reading and overall passing %. But those declines were only a fraction of percent.

# Pyber_Analysis
Python, Pandas and Matplotlib analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

A deep dive into ride-sharing data to evaluate differences in fares by city type as well as weekly fare breakout by city type. The analysis to be provided to the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Analysis

We can examine the results more visually in the image below, but here are some key takeaways by city types
- Total rides were highest in Urban area: 1625
- Urban areas also had the most drivers: 2405
- Total Fares were highest in Urban areas: $39,854.38
- Average fares per ride and per driver were much lower in urban areas. They were highest in rural areas.

Looking at weekly trends by city type below, we can see that peak fares were the highest in urban and suburban areas third week of February, however in rural areas they were the highest at the beginning of April.

## Summary

- Urban areas should remain the main focus for the business, they are responsible for most volume and overall revenue. 
- A good way to expand the business opportunities will be initiatives to increase the volumes in rural areas where the fares per ride and per driver are much higher than the urban centers
- Similar recommendation for suburban areas, any initiative that increase the volumes of rides in this area will increase the profitability of the busienss.
